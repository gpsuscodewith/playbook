The main objective of following prioritized planning principles is to align project stakeholders on how proposed initiatives and their projects fit and support the organization’s Strategic Plan.

## Product Backlog Summary
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of feature items that might be needed in the project’s final product. It is a single source of requirements. The product Backlog updates as new requirements, fixes, features, and details are being changed or added.

Backlog refinement (formerly known as backlog grooming) is when the product owner and some, or all, of the rest of the team review items on the backlog to ensure the backlog contains the appropriate items, that they are prioritized, and that the items at the top of the backlog are ready for delivery. 

## Product Backlog Activities
This activity occurs on a regular basis and may be an officially scheduled meeting or an ongoing activity. Some of the activities that occur during this refinement of the backlog include:
1. Removing user stories that no longer appear relevant
2. Creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
3. Re-assessing the relative priority of stories
4. Assigning estimates to stories which have yet to receive one
5. Correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information
6. Splitting user stories which are high priority but too coarse grained to fit in an upcoming iteration
